Difference between append and the append child

1.Append Child 
===> Both append and the append child method in javascript are used to add new node to the DOM
But they have some key difference in there uses and the capability

   ***APPENDCHILD
   .Type of node:Only accept single node(element or text node)
   
   .Return value: Returns the append child node.
   
   .Browser support: support all modern and the old browser.

   ****APPEND: 
   . Type of Nodes: Can accept a mixture of Node objects and DOMStrings (text).

   . Multiple Arguments: Can accept multiple arguments, allowing multiple nodes or strings to be appended at once.

   . Return Value: Does not return any value.

   .Browser Support: Supported in all modern browsers, but not in Internet Explorer.

                          CDN(content delivery network)
  ===> A CDN, or Content Delivery Network, is a network of servers distributed geographically 
  across multiple locations. The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver content to users more 
  efficiently by reducing latency and improving load times.

  ===>Instead of hosting the React library files locally or bundling them with your 
  application, you can load them directly from a CDN. This can reduce your application's 
  initial load time and leverage the CDN's global network for faster content delivery.

  =CDN is a place where react library is hoisted.
  
  Example of including React and ReactDOM from a CDN in an HTML file:
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>React with CDN</title>
    <!-React Library from CDN -->
<!--- <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>->
    <!- ReactDOM Library from CDN -->
<!---- <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>--->
<!-- </head>
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script> -->
<!-- // Example React code -->
<!-- const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');
        ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
    </script>


</body>
</html> -->

<!-----To setup react in the html file, you can add react and react dom library from cdn
and write your react code directly in the html file

==> When we create root and rendering something inside it then this is the job of the DOM

===>react.createElement it just creating h1 element inside react ie core react thing but when
we have put this h1 in dom or to a browser then we use reactdom libraries create root method
and this will create root 
==> root is the place where all the react code will run.every thing that we will render
we will render inside the root

@18/06/2024

Removing someting from the dom and putting something into the dom tree  is costly operation
and all this framework and library are try to optimize this and react is also comes with the
philosophy that when ever you need to do anything on the webpage do it using javascript and 
that is why react give us these helper function to make this things work in very perfectent
way.
==> So react comes with the philosophy of writing or manupulating the dom using javascript
      
      
                   IMportant question


Q.WHAT IS PROP IN REACT?
===> prop is a short form of the property in a react are a mechanism to pass data from parent
component to a child componenet They are similar to the html attribute ,but they can pass more 
complex data and the function

  KEY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PROP

  1.READ ONLY: prop are immutable,meaning a component cannot modify it own prop

  2.DATA FLOW:Prop allow data flow from parent to its child component,promoting a 
  unidirectional data flow(also known as one way data binding)

  3.COMPONENT: Both functional and class component can receive and use prop.


Q.What is cross origin in the react file?

===?The crossorigin attribute in the <script> tag is used to handle the cross-origin requests 
    for the scripts being loaded. It is particularly relevant when you're loading resources 
    (like JavaScript files) from a different origin (e.g., a different domain) than the one 
    your web page is hosted on.
